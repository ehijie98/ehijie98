## 🧠 Skills

### Communication  
Throughout my career, I’ve developed strong communication skills, from presenting strategic hiring solutions to C-level executives to collaborating effectively in agile software teams. While training as a developer, I ran pair-programming sessions to help others understand unit testing and mocking — receiving great feedback for clarity and approachability.  

### Problem Solving & Adaptability  
Transitioning from recruitment into software development required learning new technologies quickly and applying them in real projects. I thrive in environments that demand logical thinking and adaptability - whether debugging code or streamlining a workflow.  

### Team Collaboration  
My background in client-facing work and agile environments means I’m comfortable working across disciplines and cultures. I value feedback, mentorship, and open communication as key tools for growth - both personally and technically.
